## Features

### 1. Stock Threshold for WooCommerce

**Status:** ✅ Complete

Automatically adjusts product prices based on current stock levels, following a three-tier logic: prices rise when stock is scarce and drop when stock is high. A customer-facing message also displays wherever the product appears.

#### How the price logic works

| Condition | Effect |
|---|---|
| Stock ≤ Low Threshold | Price **increases** by the Low % |
| Stock ≤ Medium Threshold | Price **increases** by the Medium % |
| Stock ≥ High Threshold | Price **decreases** by the High % |
| Stock falls between thresholds | Base price applies unchanged |

The price adjustment applies to:
- The **single product page** (shown price)
- **Variable products** — each variation's price range updates individually based on that variation's stock
- The **cart** — the adjusted price is recalculated before totals are summed
- The **checkout** order summary
- **WooCommerce Blocks cart and checkout** (Store API-compatible)

#### Where stock messages appear

When the Customer Messages toggle is turned on, a highlighted notice appears:
- Below the price on the **single product page** (for variable products it appears dynamically when a variation is selected)
- Below the product name in the **cart** order summary
- Below the product name in the **checkout** order summary (both classic and Blocks checkout)
- Below the product name on the **thank-you / order confirmation** page

#### Setting it up

1. Enable **Stock Threshold for WooCommerce** on the Features page
2. Go to **CommerceKit → Stock Threshold**
3. Configure the three pricing tiers:

**Low Stock Rules**
- **Low Stock Threshold** — Stock count at or below this number is considered "low". Default: `5`
- **Price Increase %** — Percentage added to the base price. Default: `40%`

**Medium Stock Rules**
- **Medium Stock Threshold** — Stock at or below this number (but above low) is "medium". Default: `20`
- **Price Increase %** — Percentage added to the base price. Default: `20%`

**High Stock Rules**
- **High Stock Threshold** — Stock at or above this number is "high". Default: `100`
- **Price Decrease %** — Percentage subtracted from the base price. Default: `15%`

**Customer Messages**
- Toggle the switch **on** to enable visible notices for shoppers
- Write a separate message for each tier (Low / Medium / High). Defaults:
  - Low: *"Low stock - high demand item"*
  - Medium: *"Medium stock - price adjusted"*
  - High: *"High stock - clearance price"*

4. Click **Save Changes**

> **Note:** WooCommerce must have **stock management enabled** for each product (Product → Inventory → Enable stock management). Products without a stock quantity are not affected.

> **Variable products:** Each variation's stock is used independently. The price range displayed before a variation is selected reflects the adjusted range across all variations.

### 2. Buy Button for WooCommerce

**Status:** ✅ Complete

Adds a **"Buy Now"** shortcode that places a product directly into the cart and immediately redirects the shopper to checkout — skipping the cart page entirely. Any items already in the cart are cleared first so the buyer goes straight to a single-product checkout.

#### Usage

Place the shortcode anywhere: pages, posts, widgets, or custom HTML blocks.

**Basic usage:**
```
[buy_button id="123"]
```

**With custom button text:**
```
[buy_button id="123" button_text="Buy Now"]
```

**With a custom CSS class:**
```
[buy_button id="123" button_text="Get It Now" class="my-custom-button"]
```

#### Shortcode attributes

| Attribute | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | Yes | — | WooCommerce product ID |
| `button_text` | No | `Buy Now` | Text shown on the button |
| `class` | No | — | Additional CSS class added to the wrapper `<div>` |

To find a product's ID: go to **Products**, hover over a product name, and the ID appears in the URL shown at the bottom of the browser.

#### Behaviour notes

- The button renders as a standard WooCommerce-styled `<a>` link — it inherits your theme's `.button` styles
- Clicking the button clears the existing cart, adds the product, and redirects to the checkout page
- Only simple products are supported. Variable products require a variation to be selected before adding to cart, which this shortcode does not handle

### 3. WooCommerce Tips

**Status:** ⚠️ Partially complete — UI renders but tip amounts are not yet processed or added to order totals

Displays a tip/donation input form on the cart and/or checkout page. Shoppers can enter a custom tip amount and submit it. The form's visual appearance (button color, button text, text color) is configurable.

#### Setting it up

1. Enable **WooCommerce Tip** on the Features page
2. Go to **CommerceKit → Tips Settings**
3. Configure the options:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Add on Cart Page** | Show the tip form above the cart contents |
| **Add on Checkout Page** | Show the tip form above the payment section |
| **Button Color** | Background color of the submit button |
| **Button Text** | Label shown on the submit button |
| **Button Text Color** | Text color of the submit button |

4. Click **Save Settings**

> **Known limitation:** The tip form currently collects the amount from the shopper but does not add it to the order total or create a line item. This feature is under active development. It is safe to enable for UI preview, but do not use on a live store where the tip amount needs to be charged.

> **Blocks compatibility note:** The tip form uses classic WooCommerce hooks (`woocommerce_before_cart_contents`, `woocommerce_review_order_before_payment`) and does not render inside the WooCommerce Blocks cart or checkout. For Blocks-based pages, keep this feature disabled.

## Gutenberg Blocks

All CommerceKit blocks must be enabled from the **Blocks** tab in the CommerceKit admin dashboard before they appear in the editor. Enabled blocks appear under the **CommerceKit - WooCommerce** category in the block inserter.

---

### 1. Accordion Block

**Status:** ✅ Complete

An interactive accordion that shows and hides sections of content when the header is clicked. Useful for FAQs, product details, or any expandable content on any page or post.

#### Adding the block

1. In the Gutenberg editor, click the **+** inserter
2. Search for **Accordion** or browse **CommerceKit - WooCommerce**
3. Insert the block

#### Adding and removing sections

- Click **Add Section** (the button below the accordion) to add a new section
- Each section has a **title** (click to edit inline) and **content** area (supports rich text: bold, italic, links, lists)
- Click **Remove Section** inside a section to delete it (you cannot remove the last remaining section)
- Click a section header to toggle it open or closed in the editor preview

#### Customizing the appearance

Open the **Inspector Controls** (right sidebar) to access **Accordion Settings**:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Border Color** | Color picker for section borders |
| **Border Size** | Border width in pixels |
| **Border Style** | Solid / Dashed / Dotted / Double / None |
| **Title Color** | Color of section heading text |
| **Title Font Size** | Heading font size in pixels |
| **Title Font Family** | Default / Arial / Georgia / Roboto |

| **Content Font Size** | Body font size in pixels |
| **Content Font Family** | Default / Arial / Georgia / Roboto |
| **Button Background Color** | Background of the "Add Section" button |
| **Button Text Color** | Text color of the "Add Section" button |
| **Button Font Size** | Font size of the button label |
| **Button Font Family** | Font family of the button label |
| **Button Text** | Label on the add-section button |

#### Frontend behaviour

- Sections that were **open** in the editor start open on the page
- Sections that were **closed** in the editor start collapsed
- Clicking a header toggles the content open/closed (JavaScript-driven, no page reload)

### 2. Category Products Slider Block

**Status:** ✅ Complete

Displays a horizontal sliding carousel of WooCommerce products from a single category. Shows product image, name, short description, and price. Includes previous/next navigation buttons and optional autoplay.

#### Adding the block

1. In the Gutenberg editor insert **Category Products Slider**
2. Open the **Inspector Controls** sidebar under **Slider Settings**

#### Configuration

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Category ID** | ID of the WooCommerce product category to display | `0` (must be set) |
| **Title** | Heading shown above the slider | `Category Products` |
| **Product Limit** | Maximum number of products to include | `10` |
| **Autoplay** | Automatically advance slides | On |
| **Autoplay Speed (ms)** | Milliseconds between auto-advances | `3000` |

> **Finding a Category ID:** Go to **Products → Categories**, hover over a category name, and read the `tag_ID` value from the URL shown at the bottom of the browser (e.g. `.../term.php?taxonomy=product_cat&tag_ID=**12**`).

#### Frontend behaviour

- Each slide shows a product image (links to product), product name (links to product), short description, and price
- **Prev / Next** arrow buttons on the left and right edges navigate one slide at a time
- With autoplay on, slides advance automatically; hovering over the slider pauses autoplay
- If the Category ID is not set, or no published products exist in that category, a placeholder message is shown instead

### 3. FAQs Block

**Status:** 🚧 Incomplete — no editable attributes; displays hardcoded placeholder questions only

The block can be inserted into pages but shows two hardcoded demo FAQ items ("What is CommerceKit?" / "How to use this FAQ?"). The questions and answers are not editable from the editor and there are no customization options. Do not use on a live site yet.

---

### 4. Variant FAQs Block

**Status:** 🚧 Incomplete — identical to FAQs block; intended for variant-specific FAQs but not yet implemented

The block renders the same hardcoded placeholder content as the FAQs block. The distinction between "generic" and "variant" FAQs has not been built out yet. Do not use on a live site.
